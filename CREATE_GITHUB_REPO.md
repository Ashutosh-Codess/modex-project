# Create GitHub Repository First

The repository doesn't exist yet. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `modex-project`
3. Description: "Full-stack ticket booking system"
4. Choose: **Public** or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repo, run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\ashu1\Desktop\modex-project
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, use GitHub CLI or Personal Access Token (see PUSH_TO_GITHUB.md)
